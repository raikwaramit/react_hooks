# React Hooks App

Welcome to the React Hooks App, a simple React application that demonstrates the implementation and usage of React Hooks. This project is designed to help you understand how to leverage React Hooks to manage state and side effects in functional components.

## Introduction

React Hooks provide a way to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, making it easier to manage component logic without using class components. This showcase focuses on demonstrating the use of the most commonly used React Hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useReducer`.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/raikwaramit/react-hooks.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd react-hooks-showcase`
3. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
4. **Run the application:** `npm start`
5. **Open your browser and go to** `http://localhost:3000` **to view the app.**

## Implemented Hooks

1. **useState:** Demonstrates basic state management in functional components.
2. **useEffect:** Illustrates how to perform side effects, such as fetching data, in functional components.
3. **useContext:** Shows how to use the context API to share values across components.
4. **useReducer:** Displays the use of `useReducer` for more complex state logic.

## Usage Examples

Each hook is showcased in the `HookComponent.js` file with clear comments and examples. Explore this file to understand how to implement and use React Hooks in your projects.
